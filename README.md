# Big_Decimal_Int

Big_Decimal_Int is a C++ class that can hold an integer number with unlimited number of digits (no minimum or maximum boundries) and supports math functions between BigInts.

The class has the following features:
* Addition with other BigInt-s ( + operator ) 
* Subtraction with other BigInt-s ( - operator ) 
* Comparing with another BigInt ( < , > , = ) operators
* Assigning BigReal to another BigInt
* Using input and output streams with BigInt-s
* Initalizing the BigInt from different data types (BigDecimalInt, int, double, etc..)

The Goal of this project is to:
* Practice Object-Oriented-Programming concepts using C++ 
* Practice building systems using OOP modeling and design with C++
* Practice working in a team and integrating the code together to come up with a final working program
